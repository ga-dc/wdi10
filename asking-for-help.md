# Asking For Help

- We ask that you take the following steps when dealing with technical questions, e.g. "Why isn't my code working?"
  1. Try something else
  2. Look at Google
  3. Look at the lesson plan
  4. Ask another classmate
  5. Post it in the "Tech Support" slack channel
  
- If your question is "Why doesn't this work?" or "My code is broken," we'll immediately rebuff you and ask you to be more specific. **The two things you must provide us with are:**
  - An error message. Give us a screenshot of the whole message, or copy and paste the first 3 lines.
  - The relevant piece of code you wrote. *Not* your entire code file.
  
- If we see you "thrashing" or "throwing spaghetti at the wall" -- panicking and typing random things without any thought -- we're going to tell you to stop, take a break, and go do something else.

- If you ask for help and it seems you haven't tried the appropriate Google search, we'll probably use "SlackOverflow" plugin, which simply displays the first 5 StackOverflow results that match a query. It's not that we're mean or that we're too busy: We try hard to not just give anyone answers because that's not a sustainable approach to learning programming.

## After hours

**After 6pm**, aside from during [office hours](office-hours.md), instructors may but **probably will not** respond to *technical* questions, *regardless of how urgent it is*. This is for our work-life balance as well as yours! If you have **logistical or non-technical questions** please contact your squad instructor, or if they're not available, any instructor.

## Can students respond to other students' issues?
**YES!**

## So, when *should* I seek out an instructor in-person?
**We really want you talk to us when it's an emotional issue** more than a technical one.

For technical problems, seek us out in person when you've submitted an issue, and have spent more than 15 minutes trying to solve the problem yourself, 15 minutes Googling, and 15 minutes asking other students for help (in-person, on Slack, etc).
